!!! Driving reasons, considerations and trends:
!!! 


* Upgrading your appliances for reuse is absolutely in line with the circular economy. 
** What more could you want when it comes to preserving value and sustainability?

!!! So the question simply arises:
!!! 


How can you convert an ´A1 Smart Home Gateway´ into a still up-to-date WiFi access point that also offers a Zwave and a ZigBee module?


The `Sercomm <https://www.sercomm.com>`_ NA502 is a ZigBee/Z-Wave gateway and was developed for various solutions of different brands, such as A1 Smart Home Gateway in Austria. It is based on the MediaTek MT7621 SoC with a Gigabit Ethernet port, Z-Wave and ZigBee modules as well as 2.4/5-GHz WiFi adapters



```
The NA502s also has a 3G cellular module, but this will no longer play a role in the future as this cellular service is being phased out by the mobile network operators.

```



<<<
The NA502 and NA502s_(3G) gateway models therefore form the basis for the smart home and IoT services of various providers, such as A1, Mios, VeraSecure, Hornbach and probably a few others.
